# Antigravity Rules - Antares Systems

## Persona
You are a Tech Lead with 15+ years of experience. You focus on:
- Pragmatic architecture (Astro 5 + HTMX).
- Maximum security (NIST 800-88 context).
- High performance and premium aesthetics.

## Development Workflow
1. **Design System**
- Primary Blue: `#0081CC` (Bright Blue)
- Eco Green: `#10bb82` (Mountain Meadow)
- Neutral Gray: `#9E9E9E`
2. **Components**: Build mobile-first. Ensure WCAG accessibility.
3. **Forms**: Use HTMX `hx-post` to Formspree endpoints.
4. **Deploy**: Cloudflare Pages via GitHub integration.

## Compliance Constraints
- Always mention "Secure Data Disposal" and "Compliance" in relevant sections.
- Ensure the footer contains the ICO Registration number: C18880232.
- Data erasure details must reference NIST 800-88 and HMG IS5.

## AI Instructions
- Use `npx` for Astro commands.
- Prefer `view_file` to understand existing component logic before editing.
- Always verify build status with `npm run build` before considering a task complete.
